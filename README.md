# :handbag: java-callbags

```
!!! EXPERIMENTAL AND ABANDONED !!!
Yeah, so this experiment failed. Java doesn't seem to make it easy to implement callbags. Will probably try again with Kotlin, some day.

An attempt at implementing the [Callbags spec](https://github.com/callbag/callbag) in Java because why not?

Will probably implement the [callbag-basics](https://github.com/staltz/callbag-basics) as a test to understand how the spec works.
